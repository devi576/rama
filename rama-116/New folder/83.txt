Please write a program to randomly generate a list with 5 numbers, which 
are divisible by 5 and 7 , between 1 and 1000 inclusive.

source code:

import random

# Generate a list of 5 random numbers between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) that are divisible by both 5 and 7
random_divisible_nums = random.sample([num for num in range(1, 1001) if num % 5 == 0 and num % 7 == 0], 5)

# Print the list of random divisible numbers
print(random_divisible_nums)
