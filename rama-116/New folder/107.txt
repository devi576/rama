Write a program to solve a classic ancient Chinese puzzle: We count 35 
heads and 94 legs among the chickens and rabbits in a farm. How many 
rabbits and how many chickens do we have?

source code:

c + r = 35
4r + 2c = 94
def solve_puzzle(heads, legs):
    # Calculate the number of rabbits using the head count
    rabbits = (legs - 2 * heads) / 2
    # Calculate the number of chickens using the rabbit and head counts
    chickens = heads - rabbits
    # Check if the solution is valid (i.e. positive integer values)
    if rabbits >= 0 and chickens >= 0 and rabbits == int(rabbits) and chickens == int(chickens):
        return int(chickens), int(rabbits)
    else:
        return None

# Test the function with the given input
chickens, rabbits = solve_puzzle(35, 94)
if chickens and rabbits:
    print(f"The number of chickens is {chickens} and the number of rabbits is {rabbits}")
else:
    print("No valid solution exists.")
output:
The number of chickens is 23 and the number of rabbits is 12
