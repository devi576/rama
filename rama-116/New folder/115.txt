 You are given a string.Your task is to count the frequency of letters of the 
string and print the letters in descending order of frequency.
If the following string is given as input to the program:
aabbbccde
Then, the output of the program should be:
b 3
a 2
c 2

source code:
from collections import defaultdict

# Get input string from user
s = input()

# Create dictionary to count frequency of characters
freq_dict = defaultdict(int)
for c in s:
    freq_dict[c] += 1

# Sort dictionary in descending order based on values
sorted_dict = dict(sorted(freq_dict.items(), key=lambda item: item[1], reverse=True))

# Print characters and their frequencies in descending order
for k, v in sorted_dict.items():
    print(k, v)
