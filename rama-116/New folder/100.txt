 With a given list [12,24,35,24,88,120,155,88,120,155], write a program 
to print this list after removing all duplicate values with original order 
reserved.

source code:
original_list = [12,24,35,24,88,120,155,88,120,155]

# create a new list to hold the unique values in original order
new_list = []

# iterate over the original list and append each element to new_list only if it's not already there
[new_list.append(i) for i in original_list if i not in new_list]

# print the new list with duplicates removed
print(new_list)
