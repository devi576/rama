Please write a program which count and print the numbers of each 
character in a string input by console.
Example: If the following string is given as input to the program:
abcdefgabc
Then, the output of the program should be:
a,2
c,2
b,2
e,1
d,1
g,1
f,1

source code:
string = input("Enter a string: ")
count = {}

for char in string:
    if char in count:
        count[char] += 1
    else:
        count[char] = 1

for char in count:
    print(char, count[char])
