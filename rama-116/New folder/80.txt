Please write a program to output a random number, which is divisible by 5 
and 7, between 10 and 150 inclusive using random module and list 
comprehension.

source code:

import random

# Generate a list of numbers between 10 and 150 (inclusive) that are divisible by both 5 and 7
divisible_nums = [num for num in range(10, 151) if num % 5 == 0 and num % 7 == 0]

# Choose a random number from the list
random_divisible_num = random.choice(divisible_nums)

# Print the random number
print(random_divisible_num)
