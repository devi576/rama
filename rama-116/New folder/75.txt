75. Please write a binary search function which searches an item in a sorted 
list. The function should return the index of element to be searched in the 
list.

source code:
lst = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
target = 5

result = binary_search(lst, target)

if result == -1:
    print(f"{target} not found in list.")
else:
    print(f"{target} found at index {result}.")

output:
5 found at index 2.
