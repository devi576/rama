You are given words. Some words may repeat. For each word, output its 
number of occurrences. The output order should correspond with the input 
order of appearance of the word. See the sample input/output for 
clarification.
If the following string is given as input to the program:
4
bcdef
abcdefg
bcde
bcdef
Then, the output of the program should be:
3
2 1 1

source code:

n = int(input())
words = []
counts = {}

# Read in the words and count their occurrences
for i in range(n):
    word = input().strip()
    words.append(word)
    if word in counts:
        counts[word] += 1
    else:
        counts[word] = 1

# Output the counts in the order of appearance
for word in words:
    print(counts[word])
