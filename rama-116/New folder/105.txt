Please write a program which accepts a string from console and print the 
characters that have even indexes.
Example: If the following string is given as input to the program:
H1e2l3l4o5w6o7r8l9d
Then, the output of the program should be:
Helloworld

source code:
string = input("Enter a string: ")

# Using list comprehension to get characters with even indices
result = ''.join([string[i] for i in range(len(string)) if i % 2 == 0])

print(result)
