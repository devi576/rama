required to find the runner-up score. You are given scores. Store them in a 
list and find the score of the runner-up.
If the following string is given as input to the program:
5
2 3 6 6 5
Then, the output of the program should be:

source code:
n = int(input()) # number of participants
scores = list(map(int, input().split())) # scores as list
scores = list(set(scores)) # remove duplicates
scores.sort() # sort in ascending order
print(scores[-2]) # print the second largest score
