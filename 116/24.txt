24. Python has many built-in functions, and if you do not know how to use it, 
you can read document online or find some books. But Python has a built-in 
document function for every built-in functions.
Please write a program to print some Python built-in functions documents, 
such as abs(), int(), raw_input()
And add document for your own function.
source code:
# print the documentation for abs()
print(help(abs))

# print the documentation for int()
print(help(int))

# print the documentation for input() (in Python 3.x)
print(help(input))

# print the documentation for raw_input() (in Python 2.x)
print(help(raw_input))

# define a custom function
def my_function():
    """
    This is the documentation for my_function.
    It does nothing but print a message.
    """
    print("Hello from my_function!")

# print the documentation for my_function
print(help(my_function))
