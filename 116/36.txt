36. Define a function which can generate a list where the values are square of 
numbers between 1 and 20 (both included). Then the function needs to 
print the last 5 elements in the list.
source code:
def print_last_five_squares():
    squares = [x**2 for x in range(1, 21)]
    print(squares[-5:])

print_last_five_squares()

output:
[256, 289, 324, 361, 400]
