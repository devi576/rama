33. Define a function which can generate a dictionary where the keys are 
numbers between 1 and 20 (both included) and the values are square of 
keys. The function should just print the keys only.
source code:
def print_dict_keys():
    # Generate the dictionary with keys as numbers between 1 and 20 and values as squares of keys
    my_dict = {x: x**2 for x in range(1, 21)}

    # Print the keys of the dictionary
    print(my_dict.keys())

output:
print_dict_keys() # Output: dict_keys([1, 2, 3, ..., 20])
