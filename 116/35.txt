35. Define a function which can generate a list where the values are square of 
numbers between 1 and 20 (both included). Then the function needs to 
print the first 5 elements in the list.
source code:
def print_first_five_squares():
    squares = [i**2 for i in range(1, 21)]
    print(squares[:5])

print_first_five_squares()  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
