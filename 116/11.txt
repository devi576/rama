11. Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma separated 4 digit 
binary numbers as its input and then check whether they are divisible by 5 
or not. The numbers that are divisible by 5 are to be printed in a comma 
separated sequence.
Example:
0100,0011,1010,1001
Then the output should be:
1010

source code:
binary_nums = input("Enter comma-separated 4 digit binary numbers: ").split(','))
result = []
for num in binary_nums:
    decimal_num = int(num, 2)
    if decimal_num % 5 == 0:
        result.append(num)
print("The binary numbers divisible by 5 are: " + ','.join(result))

input :
0100,0011,1010,1001
output :
1010
