22. Write a program to compute the frequency of the words from the input. 
The output should output after sorting the key alphanumerically.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
New to Python or choosing between Python 2 and Python 3? Read Python 2 or
Python 3.
Then, the output should be:
2:2
3.:1
3?:1
New:1
Python:5
Read:1
and:1
between:1
choosing:1
or:2
to:1

source code:
from collections import defaultdict

# take input from the user
input_str = input("Enter the input string: ")

# create a defaultdict to store the frequency of each word
freq_dict = defaultdict(int)

# split the input string into words and update the frequency count
for word in input_str.split():
    freq_dict[word] += 1

# sort the frequency dictionary by keys alphabetically
sorted_dict = dict(sorted(freq_dict.items()))

# print the frequency of each word
for word, freq in sorted_dict.items():
    print(f"{word}:{freq}")
