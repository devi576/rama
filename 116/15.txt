15. Use a list comprehension to square each odd number in a list. The list is 
input by a sequence of comma-separated numbers. Suppose the following 
input is supplied to the program:
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
Then, the output should be:
1,9,25,49,81
source code:
nums = input("Enter comma-separated numbers: ")
nums_list = nums.split(",")
squared_odds = [str(int(num)**2) for num in nums_list if int(num)%2 != 0]
print(",".join(squared_odds))

input:
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
output:
1,9,25,49,81
