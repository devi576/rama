70. The Fibonacci Sequence is computed based on the following formula:
 f(n)=0 if n=0
f(n)=1 if n=1
f(n)=f(n-1)+f(n-2) if n>1
Please write a program to compute the value of f(n) with a given n input by 
console.
Example: If the following n is given as input to the program:
7
Then, the output of the program should be:
0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13
In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to 
be a console input.

source code:
def fibonacci(n):
    """
    Returns the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth term.
    """
    sequence = []
    a, b = 0, 1
    for i in range(n):
        sequence.append(a)
        a, b = b, a + b
    return sequence

n = int(input("Enter a value for n: "))
fib_sequence = fibonacci(n)
print(fib_sequence)

output:
Enter a value for n: 7
[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8]
