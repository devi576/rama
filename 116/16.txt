16. Write a program that computes the net amount of a bank account based a 
transaction log from console input. The transaction log format is shown as 
following:
D 100
W 200
D means deposit while W means withdrawal.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
D 300
D 300
W 200
D 100
Then, the output should be:
500

source code:
net_amount = 0

while True:
    transaction = input("Enter transaction (D/W amount): ")
    if not transaction:
        break
    parts = transaction.split()
    if parts[0] == 'D':
        net_amount += int(parts[1])
    elif parts[0] == 'W':
        net_amount -= int(parts[1])

print("Net amount:", net_amount)

input:D 300
      D 300
      W 200
      D 100
output:500
