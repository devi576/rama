20. Define a class with a generator which can iterate the numbers, which are 
divisible by 7, between a given range 0 and n.

source code:
class DivisibleBySeven:
    def __init__(self, n):
        self.n = n
    
    def generate(self):
        for i in range(self.n):
            if i % 7 == 0:
                yield i

# create an instance of the class
divisible_by_seven = DivisibleBySeven(100)

# use the generator to iterate the numbers
for num in divisible_by_seven.generate():
    print(num)
