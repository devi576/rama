48. Write a program which can map() to make a list whose elements are square 
of numbers between 1 and 20 (both included).
source code:
squares = list(map(lambda x: x**2, range(1, 21)))
print(squares)

output:[1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121, 144, 169, 196, 225, 256, 289, 324, 361, 400]
