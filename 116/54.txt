54. Define a class named Rectangle which can be constructed by a length and 
width. The Rectangle class has a method which can compute the area.
source code:
class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self, length, width):
        self.length = length
        self.width = width
        
    def area(self):
        return self.length * self.width
# Create a rectangle with length 5 and width 3
r = Rectangle(5, 3)

# Compute and print the area of the rectangle
print("Area of rectangle:", r.area())

output:
Area of rectangle: 15
