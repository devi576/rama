21. A robot moves in a plane starting from the original point (0,0). The robot 
can move toward UP, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT with a given steps. The trace 
of robot movement is shown as the following:
 UP 5
DOWN 3
LEFT 3
RIGHT 2

source code:
class Robot:
    def __init__(self):
        self.x = 0
        self.y = 0
    
    def move(self, direction, steps):
        if direction == "UP":
            self.y += steps
        elif direction == "DOWN":
            self.y -= steps
        elif direction == "LEFT":
            self.x -= steps
        elif direction == "RIGHT":
            self.x += steps

# create a new robot
robot = Robot()

# move the robot according to the given trace
robot.move("UP", 5)
robot.move("DOWN", 3)
robot.move("LEFT", 3)
robot.move("RIGHT", 2)

# print the final position of the robot
print(f"The final position of the robot is ({robot.x}, {robot.y})")
