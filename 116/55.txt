55. Define a class named Shape and its subclass Square. The Square class has an 
init function which takes a length as argument. Both classes have a area 
function which can print the area of the shape where Shape's area is 0 by 
default.
source code:
class Shape:
    def area(self):
        return 0

class Square(Shape):
    def __init__(self, length):
        self.length = length
        
    def area(self):
        return self.length ** 2
# Create a square with length 5
s = Square(5)

# Compute and print the area of the square
print("Area of square:", s.area())

output:
Area of square: 25
