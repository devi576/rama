53. Define a class named Circle which can be constructed by a radius. The 
Circle class has a method which can compute the area.
source code:
class Circle:
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self.radius = radius
        
    def area(self):
        return 3.14 * self.radius ** 2
# Create a circle with radius 5
c = Circle(5)

# Compute and print the area of the circle
print("Area of circle:", c.area())

output:
Area of circle: 78.5
