2. Write a program which can compute the factorial of a given numbers.The 
results should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single 
line.Suppose the following input is supplied to the program: 8 Then, the 
output should be:40320.

source code:

num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
factorial = 1
for i in range(1,num+1):
    factorial *= i
    print(factorial)

input 1:
    8
output 1:
  40320
