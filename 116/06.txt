6. Write a program that calculates and prints the value according to the given 
formula:
Q = Square root of [(2 * C * D)/H]
Following are the fixed values of C and H:
C is 50. H is 30.
D is the variable whose values should be input to your program in a commaseparated sequence.For example Let us assume the following comma 
separated input sequence is given to the program:
100,150,180
The output of the program should be:
18,22,24


source code:

import math
C = 50
H = 30
D = input("Enter comma-separated sequence of D values: ")
D_list = D.split(",")
result = []
for i in D_list:
     Q = int(math.sqrt((2 * C * int(i)) / H))
     result.append(str(Q))
     print(",".join(result))

input 1:
100,150,180
output 1:
18,22,24
