45. Write a program which can filter() to make a list whose elements are even 
number between 1 and 20 (both included).
source code:
def get_even_numbers():
    numbers = list(range(1, 21))
    even_numbers = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers))
    return even_numbers

print(get_even_numbers())

output:
[2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20]
